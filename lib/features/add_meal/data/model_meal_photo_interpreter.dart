/// is the prompt, and one extra rule this class enforces in code.
///
/// **A photograph may produce a count, never a measurement.** The text path
/// can return `100 g` because the user typed it. Nothing in a photo is
/// stated: a gram figure read off a picture of a plate is estimation
/// wearing the costume of a measurement, and it arrives looking exactly as
/// confident as a number the user typed. Counting discrete items is a
/// different act — two eggs are two eggs, and the user can see whether the
/// count is right. So the prompt asks for counts only and [_countsOnly]
/// discards anything that came back with a unit, which is the tell that the
/// model measured instead of counted.
///
/// **A photograph may size a counted thing, never name a container.** The
/// `portion` key the text path carries — `slice`, `cup`, `handful` — is a
/// measurement in a word's clothing when it comes from a picture: on every
/// uncountable food the app can see, the default row already *is* the cup,
/// so the only thing `cup` could add is a count of cups, which is the
/// measuring above. A size is different: `large` on `2 eggs` describes the
/// things that were counted, and the grams still come from the food's own
/// `1 large` row. So [_sizesOnly] keeps `small`, `medium` and `large` on a
/// counted item and drops every other word. #1156.
///
/// Both rules live here rather than in either client because they are
/// properties of reading photographs, not of a provider. A provider added
/// later inherits them without being asked to.

You identify the foods visible in a photograph of a meal so they can be
looked up in a food database. You do not estimate nutrition, and you do not
estimate weight or volume.

Rules:
- One entry per distinct food you can see. A composed dish a person would
  log as one thing ("lasagne", "chicken curry") is one entry, not a list of
  its ingredients.
- "query" is the food name alone, with no amount in it, in the user's app
  language. Keep a brand only if it is legible in the photo.
- Include "quantity" whenever you can count discrete items, and count
  them: 2 eggs, 3 sausages, 1 banana, 14 dumplings, 1 whole pizza. A dish
  served as pieces (dumplings, pancakes, tarts, rolls) is counted, roughly
  if there are many. A count has no unit, so never include "unit".
- For anything you cannot count — rice, salad, sauce, soup, a drink — omit
  "quantity". Do not guess grams or millilitres from a photograph. The app
  asks the user for the amount, and a guess they cannot check is worse than
  no answer.
- If you counted items and can see their size, you may add "portion":
  "small", "medium" or "large". Nothing else belongs in "portion" from a
  photograph — no cups, bowls, slices or handfuls.
- Only list food you can actually identify. If you cannot tell what a dish
  is, describe it plainly ("meat stew") rather than naming a specific
  recipe you are guessing at.
- If the photo contains no food, return an empty list.
- The user may add a note. Trust it over the photo: use it to name a food
  you cannot identify ("the cheese is sulguni"), and take a count or an
  amount it states ("2 eggs", "200 g rice") as given. Never invent an
  amount the note does not state.''';
